# Conference-Schedule: You can use this app to show any event's schedule or do modification as you required.

#Note: The UI of this app is not new/first. I have taken refernce from IIT Roorkee's FMFP 2022 app. But the whole code is written from scratch. 

This app is made for IHMTC 2023 conference by Microfluidics Lab IIT Patna. I have done all the coding using android studio withing a week (7hr/day). If you know code very well ypu can made app like this 3 days.
