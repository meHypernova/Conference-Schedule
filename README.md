This app is made for IHMTC 2023 conference by Microfluidics Lab IIT Patna. I have done all the coding using android studio withing a week (7hr/day). If you know code very well you can make an app like this withing 2-3 days.

# Conference-Schedule: You can use this app to show any event's schedule or do modification as you required.

App's Structure has used: Recycler, TabLayout, CardView, Recycler (Hidden) etc

#Note: The UI of this app is not new/first. I have taken refernce from IIT Roorkee's FMFP 2022 app. But the whole code is written from scratch. 

App's Interface: In Android Studio
